./sharper doesn't actually work

fails with larger than MAX_IMG_SZ images, but doesn't say why or have check to avoid

    doesn't fail with sharpen for some reason, seg faults with others


Segmentation fault with images as large as 1920x1080x3, even with adequate memory allocation. Required reduction in MAX_IMG_SZ
